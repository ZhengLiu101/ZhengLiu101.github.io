Dr. Zheng Liu works as a technique specialist on search and recommendation algorithms in Poisson Lab, 2012 Labs, Huawei Tech Co., Ltd. He was affiliated with Microsoft Research Asia as a senior researcher in Social Computing and Natural Language Computation. He graduated from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology with a PhD degree in computer science and engineering. His research covers a broad scope of problems in search and recommendation. Recently, he focuses on developing **retrieval-oriented pre-training algorithms** and **end-to-end optimized IR systems**. His has conducted a series of product-driven research projects in Huawei and Microsoft, which contribute to Petal Search, Bing Sponsored Search, Microsoft News, etc.
